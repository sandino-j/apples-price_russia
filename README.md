# 📜 What I Learned Today

This small project is my **first Data Science project**, focused on the **analysis of apple prices** in different cities in Russia. In this project, I learned:  
- How to load a dataset using `numpy.loadtxt()`  
- How to use the `delimiter` parameter to set commas as separators  
- How to use `usecols` to select only the columns I want to analyze  
- How to create sequences with `np.arange()`  
- How to manipulate data by selecting specific columns and rows  
- How to transpose a matrix with `.T` to convert rows into columns  
- How to use `.size` to check the total number of elements in the data  
- How to plot charts with X and Y axes showing dates and prices

## 📊 What the Project Does

The project analyzes a dataset of apple prices in 5 Russian cities:  
**Moscow, Kaliningrad, Petersburg, Krasnodar, and Ekaterinburg**.  

For now, the code plots the prices of **Moscow** over time, and the prices of all cities are prepared for future visualization.  
I am still learning how to plot all cities together in a comparative chart.
